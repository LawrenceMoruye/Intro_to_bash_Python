    "# Bash script programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash script is set of commands in plain text file. In bash script, rather than typing the commands on the terimanal we write them and save to a text file. The script then can be executed using `bash` command. This has the following advantages:-\n",
    "1. We can run the file many times, which would require a lot of time if we have to type the commands on the terminal\n",
    "2. Powerful programming constructs\n",
    "\n",
    "As any programming language bash script programming has language construct such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions and many more. But In this tutorial we will look at some of them."

    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs have two important components. The first is instructions and the second is data. Instruction is a command to program to perform certain task. Inorder to execute the instructions the programs often need data. The data should be placed in some memory area and we need a pointer or reference to that memory area. This references are called variables. As the name indicates the value of those variable might change over the course of the program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "As many programming languages bash script programming language also has variables to store values/data.\n",
